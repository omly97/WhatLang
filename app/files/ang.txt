Python virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree 
that includes a Python installation and number of additional packages.
The main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated 
environment for different Python projects. This way you can install a 
specific version of a module on a per project basis without worrying 
that it will affect your other Python projects.
In this tutorial, weâ€™ll provide a step by step instructions 
about how to create Python virtual environments on Ubuntu 18.04.
